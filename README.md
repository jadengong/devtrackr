# DevTrackr API

A lightweight task management API built with FastAPI. Handles user auth, search, time tracking, and some basic analytics. This README is intended primarily for local development and personal productivity workflows.

> **Note**: This is a **localhost-only development project**. It's designed to run locally for personal use and development purposes. 

I was getting tired of juggling multiple task management tools that either had too many features I didn't need or were missing the ones I actually wanted. Most of them felt overcomplicated for simple project tracking, and the APIs were either non-existent or a pain to work with.

So I built DevTrackr to scratch my own itch - a simple API that does the basics really well. I wanted something that could handle:
- Quick task creation and updates
- Decent search without being overengineered  
- Time tracking that actually works
- A way to see what I've been working on

The goal was to keep it focused on the core functionality without all the fuss that comes with enterprise task management tools.

## **Architecture**

- **Backend**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication
- **Containerization**: Docker with health checks
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflows
- **Testing**: pytest with coverage reporting
- **Code Quality**: Black, flake8, mypy, bandit, safety

## **Quick Start**

### **Prerequisites**
- Python 3.11 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (for database)
- Git

### **Automated Setup**

The easiest way to get started is using our automated setup scripts:

**On macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Make script executable (first time only)
chmod +x setup.sh

# Run setup script
./setup.sh
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Run setup script
.\setup.ps1
```

The setup script will automatically:
- ✅ Check all prerequisites (Python, Docker, etc.)
- ✅ Create and activate a virtual environment
- ✅ Install all dependencies
- ✅ Start the PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Run database migrations
- ✅ Verify the API is working

After the script completes, you can start the development server:
```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Start the server
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

### **Manual Step-by-Step Setup**

If you prefer to set up manually or the automated script doesn't work for your environment:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/devtrackr-repo.git
   cd devtrackr-repo
   ```

2. **Start the PostgreSQL database**
   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL using Docker Compose
   docker-compose up -d db
   
   # Verify database is running
   docker ps
   ```

3. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   # Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python -m venv venv
   
   # Activate virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   python -m alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. **Start the FastAPI application**
   ```bash
   # Start the development server
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

6. **Access the API**
   - **API Documentation (Swagger UI)**: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - **Alternative API Docs (ReDoc)**: http://localhost:8000/redoc
   - **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
   - **Root Endpoint**: http://localhost:8000/

   Verify everything is working by visiting the health check endpoint or opening the Swagger UI.

### **Troubleshooting**

**Setup Script Issues:**
- If the setup script fails, check the error messages for specific issues
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running before running the setup script
- On Windows, you may need to run PowerShell as Administrator for some operations
- If you encounter permission errors, try running the script with appropriate permissions

**Common Issues:**
- **Database connection issues**: Check Docker is running and the database container is healthy
- **Port already in use**: Change the port with `--port 8001` or stop the service using port 8000
- **Migration errors**: Check that the database is running and accessible. If you see `pg_trgm` extension errors, ensure the migration includes the extension creation (see `alembic/versions/add_fulltext_search_index.py`)
- **Import errors**: Check that all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- **Python version**: Ensure you have Python 3.11 or higher installed

### **Environment Variables**

The application uses the following environment variables (with defaults):

```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg2://dev:dev@localhost:5432/devtrackr
POSTGRES_USER=dev
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dev

## **Use Case: End-to-End Workflow**

Here's a simple example of how a developer would use DevTrackr throughout their day:

### **Morning: Setup & Planning**

1. **Register/Login** - Create an account or log in to get a JWT token
   - `POST /auth/register` or `POST /auth/login`
   - Save the `access_token` for authenticated requests

2. **Create Tasks** - Add tasks for the day
   - `POST /tasks` - Create tasks with title, description, category, priority, and estimated time
   - Example: "Implement user authentication endpoint" (high priority, 180 minutes)

### **During Work: Time Tracking**

3. **Start Timer** - Begin tracking time on a task
   - `POST /time/start` - Start a timer for a specific task
   - Work on the task...

4. **Stop Timer** - Finish working on the task
   - `POST /time/stop/{time_entry_id}` - Stop the active timer
   - Time is automatically calculated and recorded

5. **Update Task Status** - Mark progress
   - `PATCH /tasks/{task_id}` - Update status (todo → in_progress → done)
   - Update actual time spent if needed

### **Throughout the Day: Finding Tasks**

6. **Search Tasks** - Find what you need
   - `GET /tasks/search?q=authentication` - Full-text search
   - `GET /tasks?priority=high&status=todo` - Filter by status and priority

### **End of Day: Review**

7. **Check Analytics** - Review productivity
   - `GET /metrics/summary` - Task statistics by status, priority, category
   - `GET /time/summary` - Time tracking summary with breakdowns
   - `GET /activity` - View activity log of all actions

### **Try It Out**

The easiest way to explore this workflow is through the interactive API documentation:
- Open **Swagger UI** at http://localhost:8000/docs
- Click the **"Authorize"** button to add your JWT token (after logging in)
- Try the endpoints directly in your browser
- All endpoints include example requests and responses

This workflow demonstrates how DevTrackr helps you: organize tasks → track time → monitor progress → analyze productivity.
